## Instructions

Copy this directory to the project root and rename it to `project`.

You may then build your site by running:
```
npm run build
```

Or, if you're using [Bun](https://bun.sh/) instead of Node.js:
```
npm run bun-build
```

Example outputs:
```
# basic example

npm run build
Build took 6.74 milliseconds

npm run build-bun
Build took 1.61 milliseconds
```

Your newly built site will be stored in `site-output`.
